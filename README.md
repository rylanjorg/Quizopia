## Abstract

This study investigates the comparative capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GitHub Copilot in coding assistance and communication within the context of Scrum and Agile methodologies. Drawing upon a review of peer-reviewed literature, which emphasizes effective Scrum Master roles, management techniques in Agile methodologies, and considerations of AI assistant capabilities and limitations, this research employs a mixed-methods approach to analyze Likert scores and qualitative observations. Results suggest GitHub Copilot's superior communication effectiveness and proficiency in handling tasks across multiple files, while GPT-3.5 exhibits a slight edge in smaller, more specific tasks, with both assistants demonstrating comparable debugging accuracy. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of AI-powered coding tools and their potential in optimizing productivity and efficiency in software development processes, thereby providing valuable insights for developers and researchers alike.
